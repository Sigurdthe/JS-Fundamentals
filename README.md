Node.js Basic Scripts

This repository contains simple Node.js scripts that demonstrate handling command-line arguments, loops, and conditional logic. Each script showcases a fundamental concept of JavaScript in the context of CLI execution using process.argv.
All scripts follow constraints such as avoiding var, using only console.log(...), and handling input without try/catch or unnecessary complexity.
